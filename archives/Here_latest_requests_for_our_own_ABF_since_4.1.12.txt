Hi,

Nicco you can import you kernel to the ABF, as cooker is now working. Please 
do not start many builds, keep at leas one at a time.

Please set to "Y" below options in kernel as these are needed for docker and 
our own ABF:

CONFIG_CGROUP_CPUACCT > it was ok
CONFIG_CGROUP_SCHED > it was ok
CONFIG_MEMCG_SWAP_ENABLED > it was disabled, enabled just now
CONFIG_CGROUP_PERF > it was disabled, enabled just now
CONFIG_CGROUP_HUGETLB > it was disabled, enabled just now
CONFIG_CGROUP_NET_PRIO > it was disabled, enabled just now
CONFIG_CFS_BANDWIDTH > it was ok
CONFIG_FAIR_GROUP_SCHED > it was ok
CONFIG_RT_GROUP_SCHED > it was disabled, enabled just now


Thanks.

Hi Nicco,
Attached you'll fin the patches and a diff against the x84_64 config.
Naming's are sorted so they load in the correct order.

Here's changed config variable.

New Setting.  CONFIG_AUFS_XATTR=y                    Old Setting # CONFIG_AUFS_XATTR is not set  
The series file and fs-aufs-standalone.patch went in the patches directory
the bfs-02-add-preempt_offset~o-should_resched().patch  one went into the QL directory.
That's it. Everything built fine then
Best,
Colin
